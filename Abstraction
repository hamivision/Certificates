Data abstraction is the concept of providing only essential information to the outside world. It's a process of representing essential features without including implementation details.

A good real-world example is a book: When you hear the term book, you don't know the exact specifics, i.e.: the page count, the color, the size, but you understand the idea of a book - the abstraction of the book

Encapsulation:

Part of the meaning of the word encapsulation is the idea of "surrounding" an entity, not just to keep what's inside together, but also to protect it.

In object orientation, encapsulation means more than simply combining attributes and behavior together within a class; it also means restricting access to the inner workings of that class.

The key principle here is that an object only reveals what the other application components require to effectively run the application. All else is kept out of view.
